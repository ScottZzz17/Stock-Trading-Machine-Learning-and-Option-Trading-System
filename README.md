## Project Overview

This project is built as a high-performance stock trading system that leverages historical market data and sentiment analysis to predict stock price trends and manage trade risks. The system is partitioned into several critical components:

- **Data Management:** A secure pipeline that ingests and refines stock, sentiment, and trading data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning modules that forecast market behavior using advanced techniques.
- **Automated Trading:** A live options trading bot that interacts with trading APIs while enforcing comprehensive risk management policies.

*Note: The underlying code and proprietary logic remain confidential to preserve competitive advantages and intellectual property.*

---

## Core Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**  
  - Efficiently clean and transform raw market and sentiment data.
  - Compute essential technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) and design custom features to capture market nuances.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  - Develop state-of-the-art machine learning models that estimate future price movements and market volatility.
  - Optimize models through iterative testing, hyperparameter tuning, and robust validation methods.

- **Live Trading Execution:**  
  - Seamlessly integrate with leading trading APIs (e.g., Alpaca) to execute options trades in a controlled, paper trading environment.
  - Embed risk management protocols, including dynamic stop loss, take profit rules, and position sizing strategies.

- **System Monitoring & Reliability:**  
  - Establish comprehensive logging, error handling, and system health monitoring to ensure operational stability.
  - Implement a modular design that allows for incremental enhancements and real-time performance adjustments.

## Demonstrative Code

### Data Preprocessing Sample

The following snippet demonstrates a simplified data preprocessing step. It reads market data, handles missing values, and computes a basic technical indicator (e.g., a 20-day Simple Moving Average) without revealing any proprietary data transformations.

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(file_path):
    """
    Load and preprocess stock data.
    
    Steps:
      - Read CSV data.
      - Drop rows with missing values.
      - Compute a 20-day simple moving average (SMA) on the 'Close' price.
    """
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    df['SMA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    return df

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Demonstration purpose: 'data/stock_data.csv' is a placeholder.
    data = preprocess_data('data/stock_data.csv')
    print(data.head())
```
Note: This snippet is for demonstration only; advanced feature engineering techniques and data enhancements are kept confidential.

## Model Training Sample

This snippet illustrates the basic structure of a model training routine using TensorFlow/Keras. It outlines the construction and training of a neural network while abstracting the proprietary model tuning and data preparation details.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

def build_model(input_dim):
    """
    Build a simple neural network model.
    
    Architecture:
      - Input layer with dimension matching the feature set.
      - Two hidden layers with ReLU activations.
      - Output layer for regression output.
    """
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

def train_model(model, x_train, y_train):
    """
    Train the model with the provided training data.
    
    Parameters:
      - x_train: Feature set.
      - y_train: Target values.
    """
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import numpy as np
    # Generate dummy data for demonstration purposes.
    x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.rand(100)
    
    model = build_model(input_dim=x_train.shape[1])
    trained_model = train_model(model, x_train, y_train)
    print("Model training complete.")
```
Note: Detailed data preparation, feature scaling, and model hyperparameter optimization processes are proprietary and omitted from this demonstration.

## Trading Integration Sample

The snippet below shows how the system interfaces with a trading API. It provides a basic structure for connecting to the Alpaca API and executing a market order, with all sensitive configurations and trading logic excluded.

```python
import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi

def initialize_api():
    """
    Initialize and return an API connection to the Alpaca paper trading environment.
    
    Note: API keys are securely managed and not exposed in this snippet.
    """
    api = tradeapi.REST('YOUR_API_KEY', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY', base_url='https://paper-api.alpaca.markets')
    return api

def execute_trade(api, symbol, qty, side='buy'):
    """
    Execute a market order via the Alpaca API.
    
    Parameters:
      - symbol: Ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL').
      - qty: Quantity of shares to trade.
      - side: 'buy' or 'sell'.
    """
    try:
        order = api.submit_order(
            symbol=symbol,
            qty=qty,
            side=side,
            type='market',
            time_in_force='gtc'
        )
        print(f"Order submitted: {order}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing trade: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    api = initialize_api()
    # Execute a sample trade for demonstration; actual trading logic is kept confidential.
    execute_trade(api, 'AAPL', 1, 'buy')
```
Note: The complete trading strategy, risk management logic, and sensitive API configurations are not included in this snippet.
